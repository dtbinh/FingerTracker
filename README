This program takes a video input and tracks markers of the hand using blob detection and correlation. 
It assigns the detected blobs into two hand objects, and stores these in a gms file.

In order to run this program the following libraries are required:
libcv
libcvaux
libhighgui
libcxcore

cvblobslib_v6p1
libgms

The makefile then needs to be ammended to reflect the location of these last two libraries.
